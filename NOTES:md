# Playwright demo

### Overview

- Very easy to set up
- Simple build-in locators, for example:
  - page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Welcome' })
  - page.getByText('To get started')
- Code generator/recorder is maybe useful sometimes and creates clean locator code
- New UI Mode seemed interesting
  - Web UI for running tests, tracing errors and with other debugging tools
- Github Action generated automatically

### Use Case

- UI tests against mock API
  - Mock Service Worker (MSW, https://github.com/mswjs/msw) could be useful for this
- Live environment testing after deployments

### TODO investigate

- Authentication in live environment
  - Create new SSO credentials
- Data changes in live environments, how to handle this
- If mock APIs are used, keeping them in sync with real APIs
